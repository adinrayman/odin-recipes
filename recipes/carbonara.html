    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon), weight after skin removed (Note 1)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (Note 2)</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks (Note 2)</li>
        <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano , finely shredded (or pecorino romano, sub parmesan, Note 3)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt (for cooking pasta)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove , finely minced (optional, Note 4)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Guanciale – Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li>Carbonara sauce – Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li>Reserve pasta water – Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook guanciale – While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li>Pasta in pan – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Mix pasta in sauce – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Serve – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
